My experience with React is coming up on a year in just a few short months. I started my coding journey a little over a year ago. So if I don't understand something I read documentation and use ChatGpt to help with the more advanced features since I don't have team to help or someone more experienced.

This is my application that is for my assignment that I was sent by Fetch. The goal was to create a way for people like ourselves that love dogs to find a match. I created this application to be able to search with ease to find that perfect dog. 

I styled everything with just using CSS. I wanted to take a chance to dive into and get better with JavaScript so I didn't use any libraries.
